For hundreds of years, **priests** continually offered **sacrifices** to **God** for people to show the punishment that they deserved for their **sins**. But those sacrifices could not take away their sin. **Jesus** is the **Great High Priest**. Unlike other priests, **he offered himself** as the only sacrifice that could take away the sin of all the people in the world. Jesus was the perfect high priest because he **took the punishment** for every sin that anyone has ever committed.
